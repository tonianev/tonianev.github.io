## About Section (Recommended)

I lead machine learning engineering with a focus on the platform layer that makes ML work in production: architecture, delivery workflows, and operating discipline.

Across pharma and retail, I have led teams and programs that improved platform throughput, reduced model productionization time, and supported measurable business outcomes. My work combines infrastructure depth with execution rigor, so teams can ship faster without sacrificing reliability.

Core areas:
- ML platform architecture and operating model design
- MLOps standards, release gates, and CI/CD workflows
- Production AI infrastructure across AWS and GCP
- Technical leadership for high-stakes delivery programs
