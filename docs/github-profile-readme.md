# Toni Anev

ML Platform Engineering Lead building production AI infrastructure, MLOps delivery systems, and engineering operating models.

I focus on the platform layer that makes machine learning reliable at scale: reproducible environments, release controls, and team workflows that improve delivery speed without sacrificing quality.

Most production implementations are private. Public artifacts below are sanitized examples of design patterns and delivery systems.

## Current Focus

- ML platform architecture for production-scale AI workloads
- Policy-driven model release workflows and operational quality gates
- Engineering systems for reproducibility, throughput, and reliability
- Technical leadership for high-stakes ML programs

## Featured Public Repositories

- [ml-platform-reference](https://github.com/tonianev/ml-platform-reference) - Reference architecture and operating model patterns for ML platforms
- [ml-release-gates](https://github.com/tonianev/ml-release-gates) - Policy-based model promotion gate evaluator
- [feature-pipeline-quality](https://github.com/tonianev/feature-pipeline-quality) - Dataset contract and quality validation CLI
- [tonianev.github.io](https://github.com/tonianev/tonianev.github.io) - Portfolio site and public case studies
- [proof artifacts](https://tonianev.com/proof.html) - Public engineering checklists and machine-readable references

## Public Outcome Highlights

- Scaled AI infrastructure supporting global R&D ML workloads
- Increased platform throughput through IaC standardization and provisioning automation
- Reduced model productionization cycle time with platform and workflow improvements
- Delivered measurable business impact from production pricing and personalization systems
