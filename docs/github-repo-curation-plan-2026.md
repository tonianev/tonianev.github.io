# GitHub Repo Curation Plan (2026)

## Goal

Maximize signal quality for recruiters and engineering leaders by making your top repos look intentional, recent, and easy to evaluate in under 2 minutes.

## Keep Pinned (Primary Signal)

- `ml-platform-reference`
- `ml-release-gates`
- `feature-pipeline-quality`
- `tonianev.github.io`

## Improve Immediately (High ROI)

1. Add a root `README.md` to `tonianev.github.io` (done in this workspace).
2. Update `ocx-dashboard` README to remove template language and describe real scope.
3. Replace placeholder clone URLs in `data-structures` and `common-algorithms` READMEs.
4. Add one architecture or workflow diagram to each featured repo.
5. Add release tags (`v0.1.0`) to the three flagship repos.

## Consider Archiving (Reduce Noise)

Archive these only if they are no longer representative of your current level:

- `Twitter-Archive-Anlysis`
- `Multivariate-Analaysis-Using-R`
- `Titanic-Survival-by-Demographic`
- `Python-ML-DS-DL`
- `Rim-Weighting-Efficiency-Reporter`
- `Outlier-Detector`
- `Spot-Finder`

If kept public, add `LEGACY` to repo descriptions and explain context in README.

## Description Cleanup Suggestions

- Fix misspellings in repo names where feasible (`Analaysis` -> `Analysis`, `Anlysis` -> `Analysis`).
- Keep each repo description in this format:
  - What it is
  - What problem it solves
  - Why it is production-relevant

## README Standard for Every Public Repo

- One-line value proposition
- Problem statement
- Architecture/approach
- Quickstart (copy/paste commands)
- Example input/output
- Test command
- Known limitations
- Status (`active`, `maintenance`, or `legacy`)

## Profile Settings Checklist

- Headline aligned with site + resume
- Website set to `https://tonianev.com`
- Location set consistently (`Toronto, Canada`)
- Profile README installed from `docs/github-profile-readme.md`
- Top 4 pins match current career narrative
