# World-Class Professional Footprint Roadmap (2026)

## Objective

Position Toni Anev as a top-tier ML Platform Engineering leader by making credibility instantly legible across website, resume, GitHub, and professional channels.

## North-Star Signals

- A hiring manager can validate scope, rigor, and outcomes in under 3 minutes.
- A staff/principal engineer can inspect artifacts and recognize production-grade thinking.
- Search engines and LLMs can parse identity, experience, and canonical sources without ambiguity.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)

### Website

- Publish crawler and machine-readability stack (`robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, `llms.txt`, JSON-LD, profile JSON endpoints).
- Keep one canonical narrative across home, work, proof, and CV pages.
- Ensure every key page links to contact and proof artifacts.

### Resume

- Maintain two versions:
  - ATS version (single-column, parser-friendly)
  - Human version (design-forward PDF)
- Keep metrics and timeline synchronized with website and LinkedIn.

### GitHub

- Set top 4 pinned repos to current platform narrative.
- Replace placeholder README language in older repos.
- Archive or mark legacy projects clearly.

## Phase 2: Authority (Week 3-6)

### Artifact Depth

- Add 2-3 more sanitized artifacts:
  - Platform RFC template
  - Incident runbook skeleton
  - Production readiness scorecard example
- Add one architecture diagram to each flagship repo.

### Content Engine

- Publish one short technical note every 2 weeks:
  - "How to design model release gates"
  - "What breaks in ML platforms at scale"
  - "How to structure platform ownership"
- Cross-post to LinkedIn with a direct link back to your proof page.

### Social Proof

- Add 2-3 recommendations on LinkedIn from peers/leaders tied to platform impact.
- Add selected talks/panels/interviews if available.

## Phase 3: Category Positioning (Week 7-12)

### Thought Leadership

- Publish one long-form piece (1500-2500 words) on ML platform operating models.
- Convert it into:
  - LinkedIn carousel summary
  - GitHub gist/checklist
  - Web artifact page update

### Recruiter Conversion

- Add role-targeted resume variants:
  - Director, ML Platform Engineering
  - Principal/Head of MLOps
  - AI Infrastructure Lead
- Add a concise "engagement modes" section on site (full-time, advisory, architecture consult).

### Search and Discoverability

- Register and monitor Search Console + Bing Webmaster.
- Track impressions/click-through for branded and role-based queries.
- Update metadata quarterly with role- and domain-specific terms.

## Ongoing Cadence (Monthly)

- Refresh one case study metric with current context.
- Ship one meaningful update to a flagship public repo.
- Review and tighten headline/bio consistency across channels.
- Re-check broken links and metadata validity.

## Measurement Dashboard

- Website:
  - branded search impressions
  - proof page visits
  - CV page to contact conversion
- GitHub:
  - profile views
  - starred flagship repos
  - README dwell/engagement proxies (clones/views)
- Professional pipeline:
  - qualified recruiter inbound
  - interview conversion rate
  - senior-level opportunity mix

## Quality Bar for Every Public Artifact

- Explicit problem statement
- Clear constraints and tradeoffs
- Implementation approach
- Measurable outcomes or expected impact
- Operational considerations (failure modes, observability, ownership)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Inflated buzzword-heavy language without concrete evidence
- Outdated or contradictory metrics across channels
- Legacy projects mixed with current flagship work without context
- Decorative artifacts with no operational rigor

## Immediate Next 5 Actions

1. Publish current site updates and submit sitemap to search engines.
2. Replace GitHub profile README with the updated version.
3. Update 2 legacy repos this week (README quality and status labels).
4. Add one architecture diagram to `ml-platform-reference`.
5. Publish first technical note and link it from `proof.html`.
