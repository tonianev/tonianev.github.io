# Engineering Leadership Principles (ML Platform)

1. Build leverage, not heroics: prioritize reusable systems over one-off wins.
2. Make tradeoffs explicit: cost, reliability, latency, and ownership must be visible.
3. Treat interfaces as products: contracts, versioning, and support expectations are mandatory.
4. Design for operations from day one: runbooks, observability, and rollback are first-class requirements.
5. Raise the bar with process discipline: small RFCs, design reviews, and postmortems compound team quality.
